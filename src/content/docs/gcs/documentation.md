## Format of Documentation
The documentation is written in Markdown, where its syntax can be found here: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
The documentation is structured in a way that each section is a separate Markdown file, which can be found in the `src/content/docs` directory.
The different sub-team documentations can be found in their respective directories.
Each file should have a blurb at the top, which is used to generate the sidebar and the page title.

## How to Contribute
To contribute to the documentation, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/content/docs` directory.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Create or edit the Markdown files as needed.
- Note, when creating a new file, make sure to include the blurb at the top of the file.
